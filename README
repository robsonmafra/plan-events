This project is going to be a site where people can announce, plan, and promote local, grassroots technical conferences. It will all start when visionary individuals suggest an event in their city. Then, as oth- ers hear about it and register their interest and/or support, we’ll pro- vide tools to help them organize the event: a to-do list, an organizer’s dashboard (to keep track of volunteers, sponsors, and potential atten- dees), a discussion forum, and, finally, a customizable event page to help with promotion.
